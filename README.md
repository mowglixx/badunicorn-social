# Badunicorn Social - (WIP)

> Badunicorn social is a programming exercise to get a feel for MERN stack programming.

## OK, what do? futhermore, why?

It's is a technical exercise with very little creativity required due to the saturation in the market with social media platforms. Social media websites embody more comunicaton methods than any other websites and handle huge amounts of data every single day, it is for this reason that it is a great training exercise to experience the problems with implementing many different types of user interaction, data manipulation, security, login, messaging, video and audio calling. All these different types of workloads lead to a varied set of challenges for both backend and frontend code.

## What tools are used?

The current plan is to create a MERN stack application, below are the current planned libraries.
